# - Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
# - Standard Scalar is used to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
# - Kmeans is used to perform kmeans clustering in the features , which is popular algorithm that partitions data into a predefined number of clusters.
# - TSNE is used for dimentionality reduction.
# - Matplotlib is used for visualization.
# - Seaborn provides informative statistical graphics.

# Load the dataset
file_path = r"C:\Users\manid\OneDrive\Desktop\churn_false.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)


# - Loading the CSV file into a pandas Dataframe.

# In[4]:


# Ensure 'Churn' column is properly formatted
df['Churn'] = df['Churn'].astype(int)


# - This Converts datatype of the churn column into the integer type.
# After Conversion if the value is 1 then it represents that the customers has churned(i.e left the service)
# if the value is 0 then it represents that the customers has not churned(i.e Retained)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)


# - StandardScaler creates helps in standardizing the feature by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
# - It Centers the data around the mean and standard deviation of 1.(for better performance)
# - fit is used to calculate the mean and standard deviation for each features in the dataset.
# - Transform uses the calculated values to standardize the features in dataset.

    kmeans.fit(X_scaled)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)


# - Here the Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of Clusters by plotting the WCSS(Within-cluster sum of squares) for different numbers of clusters.
# - First the WCSS list is created to store the wcss for different number of clusters. The loop here iterates over a range of cluster numbers from 1 to 10 helps to test the number of clusters.
# - Kmeans++ is a method for initializing the centroids that helps in speed up the convergence of the algorithm.
# - Max_iter is set as 300 that the maximum number of times the algorithm run if does not converge before.
# - n_init is set as 10 as the number of times the algorithm will run with different centroids.
# - random_state is set as 42 to show the same output while executing the code for multiple times.

# - t-SNE(t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a dimentionality reduction technique to visualize the clusters in low dimentions.
# - Here the data is reduced to 2 dimensions to facilate visualization in a 2D plot.
# - standardizing the features before applying the t-SNE helps to improve the result.
